Basically it is sorting by ads first, then twitter, then facebook posts rather than by date - and the reactions (popularity) sort doesn't seem tow ork either.

//there is issue with both sorting and filtering?

It seems so, if you press eitehr button it doesn't seem tow ork - the initial sort is the most important though.
It should by default be sorted by date.

filtering was done using buttons initally, u changed to text input?

Text input is disabled, it's just there at the moment. Doesn't do anything.


where are the boxes for filtering?
